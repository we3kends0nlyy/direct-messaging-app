This project was me making a messaging system that includes features such as a local storage system, saving contents, notification when messaging, and a gui. The gui is the biggest part of the code and it includes a wide variety of options. The gui allows users to choose from their files or create a new file if they choose. The user also has the option to edit their profile if they want. When the use logs in, they can click on any contact and their messages with the contact will show up. When the user gets a new message from a contact, that message will show up in their screen. The user can then write back to this contact if they choose to. There are many classes and methods in my code and error statements as well. There are error windows that pop up for username mistakes, connection errors, and when user info is already in use by someone else. There is also a notification window that pops up when the user gets a new message. The contacts are all displayed every time the user clicks on a contact. I programmed the code to look through all local messages and it goes through all the messages sent and received. If the from or recipient from the data matches the recipient selected, then the message is posted. If not, the message is skipped because it most likely belongs to another user. This enables my code keep the same messages even when a user switches username. However the user on the other end will have a new contact created when they get a new message from that user. I pop up a little window at the beginning with a small greeting and explanation of what to do in the gui. Overall I'm very proud of this project and what I was able to do!
