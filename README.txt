This assignment was me making a messaging system that includes features such as a local storage system, saving contents, notification when messaging, and a gui. The gui is the biggest part of the code and it includes a wide variety of options. The gui allows users to choose from their files or create a new file if they choose. The user also has the option to edit their profile if they want. When the use logs in, they can click on any contact and their messages with the contact will show up. When the user gets a new message from a contact, that message will show up in their screen. The user can then write back to this contact if they choose to. There are many classes and methods in my code and error statements as well. There are error windows that pop up for username mistakes, connection errors, and when user info is already in use by someone else.
